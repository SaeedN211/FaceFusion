# 🚀 GitHub Setup Guide for FaceFusion

This guide will help you create a GitHub repository for your FaceFusion project and share it with friends.

## 📝 Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in to your account
2. **Click the "+" icon** in the top right corner
3. **Select "New repository"**
4. **Fill in the details:**
   - **Repository name:** `facefusion` (or any name you prefer)
   - **Description:** `🎆 Open Source Video Face Swap Application - AI-powered face swapping using React + Roop engine`
   - **Visibility:** Public (so friends can access it easily)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

5. **Click "Create repository"**

## 🔗 Step 2: Connect and Push Your Code

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these in your terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/facefusion

# Add GitHub as remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/facefusion.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Example:**
```bash
# If your GitHub username is "johndoe"
git remote add origin https://github.com/johndoe/facefusion.git
git push -u origin main
```

## ✨ Step 3: Customize Your Repository

### Add Repository Topics
In your GitHub repository page:
1. Click the ⚙️ gear icon next to "About"
2. Add these topics: `face-swap`, `ai`, `react`, `video-processing`, `open-source`, `roop`, `typescript`

### Enable GitHub Pages (Optional)
To host a demo version:
1. Go to Settings > Pages
2. Select "Deploy from a branch"
3. Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
4. Your demo will be available at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/facefusion`

## 📤 Step 4: Share with Friends

Now your friends can access your project in multiple ways:

### Option 1: Direct GitHub Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/facefusion.git
cd facefusion
docker-compose up -d
```

### Option 2: Download ZIP
- Friends can click "Code" > "Download ZIP" on your GitHub repo
- Extract and run `docker-compose up -d`

### Option 3: Fork the Repository
- Friends can click "Fork" to create their own copy
- They can contribute improvements back to your repo

## 🎯 Repository Features to Enable

### 1. Issues
Enable issues so friends can report bugs or request features:
- Go to Settings > Features
- Check "Issues"

### 2. Discussions
Enable discussions for community chat:
- Go to Settings > Features

### 3. Releases
Create releases for stable versions:
```bash
# Create a tag for your first release
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "🎆 FaceFusion v1.0.0 - Initial Release"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

Then go to Releases > "Create a new release" on GitHub.

## 📱 Social Sharing

### GitHub Repository Card
Share your repository with this URL:
```
